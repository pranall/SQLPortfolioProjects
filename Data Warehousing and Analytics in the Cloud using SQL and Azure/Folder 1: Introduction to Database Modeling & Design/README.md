This project transforms a small business’s unstructured spreadsheet data into a fully designed data-management foundation suitable for future automation and analytics. The work focuses on analyzing the provided Excel file and converting its contents into three structured data models that reflect industry standards for clarity, normalization, and implementation.

**1. Conceptual Data Model**
Defines the core business entities represented in the spreadsheet and maps the high-level relationships among them. This model captures the essential data domains without technical detail.

**2. Logical Data Model**
Expands the conceptual model by introducing non-key attributes, primary and foreign keys, and junction tables where required. All structures comply with normalization principles and follow clear, domain-appropriate naming conventions.

**3. Physical Data Model**
Translates the logical design into an implementation-ready database schema. This model assigns datatypes, applies constraints, and uses consistent naming standards to prepare the system for deployment on a database platform.

Overall, the project converts raw operational data into a structured, normalized, and scalable architecture that supports efficient data management and future business growth.
