Step 1: Created an Azure free student account using a university email and verified access to the Azure portal without requiring any credit-card information. This established the cloud environment needed for the remaining tasks in the project.

Created Azure free account using “Free Trial” Subscription

Step 2: Created an Azure Storage container and performed core blob-storage operations by uploading and downloading block blobs. This established hands-on experience with Azure Storage fundamentals, container creation, and object-level data handling in the cloud.

Successfully created a blob

Step 3: Created an Azure SQL Database instance in the cloud, configuring the server, resource group, authentication, and compute settings. This provided practical exposure to provisioning managed relational databases in Azure.

Created SQL Database(assignment4week6databse) and SQL Server(assignment4week6sqlserver)

Step 4: Queried the Azure SQL Database using the built-in Query Editor. Executed the provided JOIN query to retrieve the top 10 product–category pairs from **SalesLT.ProductCategory** and **SalesLT.Product**, confirming database connectivity and successful SQL execution in the Azure cloud environment.

Result of the above SQL Query 

Step 5: Deleted the Azure resource group created for the project, automatically removing all associated services including the storage account, container, blobs, SQL server, and SQL database. This demonstrated proper cloud resource cleanup and cost-control practices.
