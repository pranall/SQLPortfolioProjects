This project builds a complete relational database system in MySQL from scratch using a provided physical data model.The dataset used is Worker Management System. All core tables for a Worker Management environment were designed, created, and populated, including departments, employees, equipment, trainers, trainings, and the required junction tables. Work included writing DDL, defining keys and constraints, inserting full datasets, and validating all structures through ordered `SELECT` queries. The project then progressed into increasingly complex SQL operations such as filtered retrievals, single-row and multi-row subqueries, distinct queries, and multi-table joins to generate detailed employee, department, equipment, and training insights. The final result demonstrates end-to-end execution of database modeling, implementation, population, and analytical querying in MySQL.
